## Darius Scott

I am skilled in website development, and am an expert in coding with programs such as HTML/CSS, PHP, MySQL, and am currently studying Python. I have also used tools such as Choreograph and Processing to code robots and design art installations. My GitHub portfolio can be found at @dsc0tt. 

I also have skills in motion graphics, graphic design, and video production. I am familiar with the Adobe suite of products and have utilized them on multiple projects with the Hirshhorn Museum.
I am skilled with computers, and have an aptitude for learning. If I am not familiar with a particular product or tool that is necessary for a job, I can learn how to use it in no time.
